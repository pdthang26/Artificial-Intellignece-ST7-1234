1. There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.
--> In my mind, artificial intelligence is a core of computer science .It is a scientific development through which a machine is developed to perform actions that fall within the scope of human intelligence, such as teaching, logic, self-correction, and self-programming. The principal aim of artificial intelligence is to make computers do the work that humans do
2. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?
--> Relationship between them: Deep learning is a component of machine learning. Likewise, artificial intelligence includes machine learning. Artificial intelligence includes both of the above. 
--> The similarities of them is a computer algorithm and can minic human behaviour
--> The differences 
Artificial intelligence is a computer algorithm which exhibits intelligence through decision making.
Machine Learning is an algorithm which allows system to learn from data.
Deep learning is a algorithm that uses deep(more than one layer) neural networks to analyze data and provide output accordingly.
3. After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.
--> Smartphones in the last few years have a camera system that applies artificial intelligence to create very beautiful photos, for example, the ability to take photos in low light or capture distant objects in high definition.
4. Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.
Deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors require the chips which obtains CPU(Central processing unit), GPU(Graphics processing unit), ASIC (Application specific integrated circuit), FPGA (Field programmable gate array) such as InTel Core, AMD Ryzen .etc
-->CPU:
Low compute density
Complex control logic
Large caches(L1$/L2$, etc.)
Optimzed for serial operations . Fewer execution units (ALUs) . Higher clock speeds
Shallow pipelines (<30 stages)
Low Latency Tolerance
Newer CPUs have more parallelism
-->GPU:
High compute density
High Computations per Memory Access
Built for parallel operations . Many parallel execution units (ALUs) . Graphics is the best known case of parallelism
Deep pipelines (hundreds of stages)
High Throughout
High Latency Tolerance
Newer GPUs: . Better flow control logic (becoming more CPU-like) . Scatter/Gather Memory Access . Don't have one-way pipelines anymore
5. Based on your current knowledge and understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.
In my opinion, artificial intelligence in the future will develop very quickly, especially in the field of high-tech products such as unmanned devices, robots that support difficult jobs in life and health.
